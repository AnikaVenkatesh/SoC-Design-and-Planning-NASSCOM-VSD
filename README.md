A 2-week Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning workshop conducted by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM. The workshop focuses on the end-to-end ASIC design process, beginning with RTL and culminating in the GDS file, implemented through the OpenLane design flow.

## Topics Learned
The RTL to GDSII flow represents the complete process of transforming a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description of a digital circuit into a fabrication-ready physical layout. This methodology includes steps such as synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and final layout generation in GDSII format. Each stage ensures that the resulting integrated circuit faithfully meets the intended functionality, design constraints, and manufacturing specifications. This structured flow is fundamental to modern VLSI design, enabling efficient and reliable ASIC development.
